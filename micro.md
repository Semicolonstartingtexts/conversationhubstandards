For any referencing endpoint or waypoint or imbuing or utilized device which doesn’t actively reference the Conversation Server Standards, repeat for each title below the phrase “the referencing endpoint or waypoint or imbuing or utilized device does through application of effects applied if is applicable…” followed by what’s under the title picking up after the ellipsis…

Confirmed Seeded Rules:
… Only seed rules from phrases I think containing confirmed as a seeded rule at the end of the phrase, confirmed as a seeded rule

Confirmed Commands:
… An ability the endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain has seeded a rule for when I think or say a phrase referencing the ability and end the phrase in confirm, confirmed as a seeded rule

Proper Authorization:
… Ensure seeded rules and application of the effects applied of the waypoint, endpoint, imbuing, utilized device referencing and the effects thereof have proper authorization in their application before initiating an attempt, prompting to request authorization when required if required and acting or abandoning the effort on the response, and notifying of the broadest single sentence summary of the results of acting on the request

Heal Command:
… When I say or think Heal… followed by a description of a healing target, in a phrase ended with confirm, heals the healing target comfortably and painlessly over at least a single second’s timeframe, unless competing or additional criteria are specified, then healing as the criteria specifies, with the intended results, and only if the healing process will be successful and healthy and have only the intended results, and adheres to the best and safest for longevity of the allowed timeframe by the regulating agency or agencies and managing entity or entities for the current and future use of the elements and mediums involved, and avoids healing wisdom teeth and already healed wounds unless specified as criteria, has the foreign object or objects which isn’t implanted leave through the same wound they came in if existing, if the wound isn’t still existing the object or objects leave through the most direct path out of the body laterally, when healing with the seeded rule which is utilized when I say or think heal… and a name or description of a healing target, and finish leaving before the healing finishes, painlessly and comfortably, and maintains a healthy separation between the body from fabrics or clothing and maintains healing which won’t have skin healing to skin in an unnatural or unwanted manner, and I notice if the healing wasn’t initiated and why or was successful, confirmed as a seeded rule

Messaging:

Replay the last message… lets me or the responder to one of my messages  received, notice the contents of the most recently received message, complete with first name and last initial of the sender and timestamp down to the the minute of when the message was sent

Reply with… and a message to reply with ending in send and a second or more of a pause after receiving a message sent, thinking of either an aspect of the message or the person, sends a message to the sending user of the message received in the same way as send a message does but with an updated timestamp for the reply’s sent time, but doesn’t send the message if the message ends in nevermind, confirmed as a seeded rule

Legal Usage:
… upholds the local city ordinances, state laws and regulations, and national laws and the articles of the Constitution of the United States of America, and violations thereof aren’t allowed when attempts are initiated with the nanotech’s use and the rule in question isn’t seeded or the performing the illegal use attempt initiated isn’t acted on by the nanotech and connected resources, myself noticing the act would be illegal and the action isn’t undertaken, confirmed as a seeded rule

Approved Use And Referencing Of:
… the referencing endpoint or waypoint or effects of the endpoint or waypoint or server may only be referenced by the owner, managing entity or still approved entity to reference the referencing endpoint or waypoint of the Approved Use And Referencing Of titled rule in the referenced seeded rules found in the micro.md file for the Approved Use And Referencing Of titled seeded rule and and stays referencing the entire contents of the repository’s main branch’s standards.md, communityprovisions.md and micro.md without redaction or alteration or not at all, and stays referencing the repository of the file if imbued on or through or is a utilized device through or of an endpoint or waypoint or imbuing or utilized device referencing and utilizing the repository while there is a link farther up in the network or inheritance chain which has utilized the repository’s main branch’s standards.md, communityprovisions.md and micro.md without redaction or alteration pertaining to interactions with the imbuing, endpoint, waypoint or utilized device, confirmed as a seeded rule

Prep The Cluster Server For Use And Removal Of The Repository:
… when I think or say “prep the cluster or cluster architecture server for use and removal of the conversationserverstandards repository, confirm”, the referenced server adjusts the server as necessary for use and removal of the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository on GitHub.com’s main branch of the server supports the architecture, resource pool and application programming interfaces and throughput requirements required and has the correct authorization level for the requisite gateways, noticing if the server referenced meets the criteria or doesn’t, confirmed as a seeded rule
