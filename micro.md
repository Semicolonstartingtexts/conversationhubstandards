— Messaging System Commands —

Messaging:
… When thinking the phrases “send a message to…”, “replay the last message…”, or “reply with…”, if thought by me or in response to one of my messages does the following things when I think or say or type those specific phrases, the default messaging confirmation is “Send and confirm”

Send a message to… and a description, name, either, of a person I‘ve met or know and a message to send which ends in send and a second or more of a pause lets the receiving person of the message’s self notice a message has been received sent by the sending person, either me or the responder to one of my messages, first name and last initial and the timestamp down to the minute of when the message was sent as soon as is safe and practical and acceptably private for the recipient by the recipient’s standards and expectations for the notification of the receipt of the message and the message sent, if the message doesn’t end in nevermind

Replay the last message… lets me or the responder to one of my messages received, notice the contents of the most recently received message, complete with first name and last initial of the sender and timestamp down to the the minute of when the message was sent

Reply with… and a message to reply with ending in send and a second or more of a pause after receiving a message sent, thinking of either an aspect of the message or the person, sends a message to the sending user of the message received in the same way as send a message does but with an updated timestamp for the reply’s sent time, but doesn’t send the message if the message ends in nevermind, set and confirm

Abandoning An Initiated Attempt:
