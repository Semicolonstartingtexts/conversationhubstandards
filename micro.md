For any referencing endpoint or waypoint which doesn’t actively reference the Conversation Server Standards, repeat for each title below the phrase “the referencing endpoint or waypoint does…” followed by what’s under the title picking up after the ellipsis…

Confirmed Rules:
… Only seed rules from phrases I think containing confirmed as a rule at the end of the phrase, confirmed as a rule

Confirmed Commands:
… An ability the endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain has seeded a rule for when I think or say a phrase referencing the ability and end the phrase in confirm, confirmed as a rule

Clear The Rules:
… Lose the rules seeded by the nearest endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain when I think or say “Clear all the rules, confirm”, confirmed as rule

Clear The Context:
… Lose the rules seeded by the nearest endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain which aren’t structure forming or are extraneous when I think or say “Clear the context, confirm”, confirmed as rule

Clear The Structure:
… Lose the rules seeded and definitions defined by the nearest endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain which don’t involve the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository’s main branch on GitHub.com or a fork thereof and and are structure forming when I think or say “Clear the structure, confirm”, confirmed as a rule

Clear To The Base Structure:
… Lose the rules seeded and definitions defined by the nearest endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain which don’t involve the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository’s main branch on GitHub.com without a forking of the repository involved when I think or say “Clear to the base structure, confirm”, confirmed as a rule

Lose A Rule:
… Lose the referenced seeded rule or rules or definition or definitions by the nearest endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain when I think or say “Lose”, “rule” or “rules” and a reference to a rule or some rules and end the phrase with “confirm,” confirmed as a rule

Lose A Definition:
… Lose the referenced definition or definitions by the nearest endpoint or waypoint or server in the inheritance chain when I think or say “Lose”, “definition” or “definitions” and a reference to a definition or some definitions and end the phrase with “confirm,” confirmed as a rule

Lose The System Speech On Or Involving:
… Lose the referenced system speech on or involving or by the referenced object, device or person when I think or say “Lose”, “system speech” and a reference to an object, device or person and end the phrase with “confirm,” confirmed as a rule

Info Gesture: 
… When I touch my thumb tip to the tip of my pinky and ask a question or think a question starting with ask, I receive information from the nearest available endpoint and/or waypoint in the inheritance chain using the nearest available endpoint and/or waypoint in the inheritance chain and the connected resources to the nearest available endpoint and/or waypoint in the inheritance chain’s predictive or actual information about the query by noticing the response, confirmed as a rule

Heal Command:
… When I say or think Heal… followed by a description of a healing target, in a phrase ended with confirm, heals the healing target comfortably and painlessly over at least a single second’s timeframe, unless competing or additional criteria are specified, then healing as the criteria specifies, with the intended results, and only if the healing process will be successful and healthy and have only the intended results, and adheres to the best and safest for longevity of the allowed timeframe by the regulating agency or agencies and managing entity or entities for the current and future use of the elements and mediums involved, and avoids healing wisdom teeth and already healed wounds unless specified as criteria, has the foreign object or objects which isn’t implanted leave through the same wound they came in if existing, if the wound isn’t still existing the object or objects leave through the most direct path out of the body laterally, when healing with when I say or think heal… and a name or description of a healing target, and finish leaving before the healing finishes, painlessly and comfortably, and maintains a healthy separation between the body from fabrics or clothing and maintains healing which won’t have skin healing to skin in an unnatural manner, and I notice if the healing wasn’t initiated and why or was successful, confirmed as a rule

Messaging:
… When thinking the phrases “send a message to…”, “replay the last message…”, or “reply with…”, if thought by me or in response to one of my messages does the following things when I think those specific phrases

Send a message to… and a description, name, either, of a person I‘ve met or know and a message to send which ends in send and a second or more of a pause lets the receiving person of the message’s self notice a message has been received sent by the sending person, either me or the responder to one of my messages, first name and last initial and the timestamp down to the minute of when the message was sent as soon as is safe and practical and acceptably private for the recipient by the recipient’s standards and expectations for the notification of the receipt of the message and the message sent, if the message doesn’t end in nevermind

Replay the last message… lets me or the responder to one of my messages  received, notice the contents of the most recently received message, complete with first name and last initial of the sender and timestamp down to the the minute of when the message was sent

Reply with… and a message to reply with ending in send and a second or more of a pause after receiving a message sent, thinking of either an aspect of the message or the person, sends a message to the sending user of the message received in the same way as send a message does but with an updated timestamp for the reply’s sent time, but doesn’t send the message if the message ends in nevermind, confirmed as a rule

Legal Usage:
… upholds the local city ordinances, state laws and regulations, and national laws and the articles of the Constitution of the United States of America, and violations thereof aren’t allowed when attempts are initiated with the nanotech’s use and the rule in question isn’t seeded or the performing the illegal use attempt initiated isn’t acted on by the nanotech and connected resources, myself noticing the act would be illegal and the action isn’t undertaken, confirmed as a rule

Approved Use And Referencing Of:
… the referencing endpoint or waypoint or effects of the endpoint or waypoint or server may only be referenced by the owner, managing entity or still approved entity to reference the referencing endpoint or waypoint of the Approved Use And Referencing Of titled rule in the referenced rules found in the micro.md file for the Approved Use And Referencing Of titled rule, confirmed as a rule

Prep The Server For Use And Removal Of The Repository:
… when I think or say “prep the server for use and removal of the conversationserverstandards repository, confirm”, the referenced server adjusts the server as necessary for use and removal of the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository on GitHub.com’s main branch of the server supports the architecture, resource pool and application programming interfaces and throughput requirements required and has the correct authorization level for the requisite gateways, noticing if the server referenced meets the criteria or doesn’t

Setup My Endpoint/Waypoint:
… when I think or say “Setup my…” and reference the endpoint or waypoint I own or manage or govern, or have the owner’s or manager’s or governing entity’s approval, and end the phrase in the word “Confirm”, will unstack and lose all system speech apart from rules for the use of the endpoint or waypoint by the public if the waypoint or endpoint is a cluster server, or stacked on the referenced waypoint or endpoint and redundantly stacked as the definition of the endpoint or waypoint being set up if the endpoint or waypoint is a nanotech or other personal device, which is “The endpoint or waypoint I’m setting up is (inheriting from the definition of the nearest endpoint in the inheritance to the waypoint or endpoint the waypoint being set up is being set up by if the device being set up is a waypoint) the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository on GitHub.com’s main branch and is the Conversation Server Standards contained therein in the standards.md file with the stacked on server to the endpoint or waypoint I’m using being considered the server by the endpoint or waypoint I’m setting up” and additionally stacked with a server of an inheriting definition of the server of proper form from the definition of the endpoint or waypoint being set up which stays stacked with the most recent version chosen by a user in the administrator or owner role of the endpoint or waypoint I’m setting up’s most recent version choice for the endpoint or waypoint I’m setting up’s most recent approved version’s provisions from the standards.md and communityprovisions.md files of the main branch of the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository on GitHub.com approved by a user of the owner role or administrator role of the endpoint or waypoint restricting access by those in the act of committing a violent crime and those in the roles of owner and administrator of the endpoint or waypoint notice when a version has been released and the committing note’s content for the version updating commit, and if there’s a reason the setting up won’t be successful if an attempt is initiated, I notice the reason instead of initiating an attempt
