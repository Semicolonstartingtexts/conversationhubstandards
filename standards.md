System Speech

Intentions, the conversation that has been had or being had by a user with a representation of the user intentions for the conversation

Comments, the conversation that has been had or being had by or on or to the user with a representation of the intention of a user which isn’t the user’s own self and which had the conversation

Imbuing, stacking on, or tracking conversation or a signifier or multiple signifiers with the representation of an intention or intentions involving an object or objects or otherwise than an object or objects external to the server or endpoint or waypoint or relay and users which have interacted with the server, imbued objects are limited to inheriting and do inherit only from the definition of or ways for general or specific use of the nearest endpoint, if the imbuing server was stacked on an endpoint, or imbuing nearest waypoint or nearest endpoint in the inheritance chain, if the device was imbued through micro and wasn’t imbued on a server stacked on a waypoint or stacked on an endpoint, or network node if the object wasn’t imbued on a server, or nearest waypoint in the inheritance chain, if the object was imbued on a server stacked on a waypoint, they were imbued on through the imbuing unless the imbuing is removed, though the same object may be imbued by different endpoints or waypoints simultaneously

Provisions, the conversation which governs the interactions between the connected users of the server and the server, stacks ubiquitously on the mappings and stays updated and consistent when changes occur to the provision on any of the mappings and may restrict which users are options for the connecting to the server or being connected to by the server or a user on the server and when the users may be connected, may be stacked, changed and unstacked only by an administrator of the server

Preferencings, the conversation which governs the server’s, endpoint, waypoint, node, or relay’s interactions regarding the user, set and stacked only by the user and only on the user, or on a mapping, if the mapping’s provisions permit, preferencings, can’t be unstacked by other users than a user’s own self 

Ways, the stacked conversation which limits or enhances any user which is in the zone’s interactions with the other users which are in the zone the user in, may only be stacked on mappings and roles which permit ways to be stacked, and aren’t allowed to be intending to the source of physically harm, hurt, injury, pain, decline in health or overabundance of health beyond a user preferred threshold defaulting to a threshold of comfort ensured, to render unconscious, comatose, deceased or to suppress or limit the consciousness of, a user, or enhance or limit in such a way as to be hindering of the conscious independence of a user, or the limit the ability to communicate independently and to do so without alteration from the intended independently generated intent for the user’s own communication being the message communicated through whichever medium the message is communicated

Confirmed Phrase and Confirmed Phrases, the most recent phrase made by a user which aren’t stacked and have been confirmed by a user in the user interactions for the user and users relevant to the interaction if the mapping’s provisions permit, a user is always stacked on the most recent confirmed phrase by the user for the user unless explicitly or generally unstacked

Sets, groups of stacked intentions for the user which can be swapped out in full, have phrases added to and removed from, built from specific phrases, or stacked and unstacked as a whole

Definitions, any phrase which references an endpoint or waypoint or server or node or relay specifically, directly or indirectly, or the effects of an endpoint or waypoint or server

System Command Speech

Declarations, system speech given with a system command, system speech which is focused on, may only be a reserved system command or declared in a provision or preferencing, may be given in any language which has words for the same words which are in the requisite phrasing to give the system command with words which share a definition or have shared definitions to the phrase’s words

Interactions, applicable with an apply system command only may be a reserved system command given with a system command, may be a system command gesture performed verbally given in a system command, or otherwise performed and may be declared in a provision or preferencing, noticing is always done in the most natural and preferred language of the user for the system and the user notices the reason why an interaction doesn’t occur if isn’t allowed or permitted using properly the explicit notice wording of the provision or way or preferencing if such wording is in the provisions or ways or preferencings of a user, or the server, or the mapping the interaction is interacting with, when there aren’t enough available resources within the owning, managing, governing and regulating entity limitations, interactions aren’t undertaken for the interaction attempt initiated, interactions ensure application of the effects applied of the waypoint, endpoint, imbuing, utilized device referencing and the effects thereof have proper authorization for interacting with the property of another entity in their application and intent and in the intentions regarding other users a requisite wholly legal intention in the interaction is required
before initiating an attempt, a pause in communication from a user of a thousand milliseconds or longer indicates the end of a phrase while the user doesn’t intend the phrase to be abandoned or continued after the pause as the same phrase without an interaction attempt initiated by the part of the phrase before the pause whether complete or incomplete

System Setup

Server Provisions, irregardless and despite of all other interaction with the endpoint, waypoint or server, or relay, or node, or other system, except for addition, adjustment and removal of provisions and uninstalling the repository in micro by the authorized administrators and owners and users, such as governing, owning, managing, regulating, and approved entities, the set of provisions that outlines a way all users of a server may interact with the server, the rest of the provisions of the server aren’t allowed priority over the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards GitHub.com repository’s main branch’s standards.md and communityprovisions.md files’ contents, without expansion, alteration or redaction, most recently approved version by the owner or administrator of the endpoint or waypoint the server is on of at least v0.4, and the definition of the endpoint, waypoint, server, relay, node, whichever is the most relevant to the provision, and the provisions of the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards GitHub.com repository’s main branch’s standards.md and communityprovisions.md files’ contents, without expansion, alteration or redaction, most recently approved version by the owner or administrator of the endpoint or waypoint the server is on of at least version v0.4, aren’t permitted to be unstacked in less than entirety or for an endpoint or waypoint to be pointed to by or stacked with a server with the provisions of Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards GitHub.com repository’s main branch’s standards.md and communityprovisions.md files’ contents, without expansion, alteration or redaction, most recently approved version by the owner or administrator of the endpoint or waypoint the server is on of at least v0.4, and aren’t permitted to be opted out of or opted in to except in entirety, as well as system speech can’t be stacked, applied or confirmed about the Conversation Server Standards except opt-in, opt-out preferencings, And as well as use of the provisions therein, the server provisions are in all the interactions of the server and the users which have consented, users which haven’t consented and aren’t being asked, aren’t interacting with the server, and the users which are being asked to consent have the provisions of the Conversation Server Standards, at most, even when the server is suspended, if the server is interacted with

User, is provisioned as an entity interacting with the server or an application of the effects applicable relevant to the server’s users, the default role of the server’s population beyond the owner of the endpoint, in interactions through a server or nodes, we understand each other in our native language

Owner, the owner of the waypoint, relay, node or the endpoint or server, without an administrator role, may stack or approve the stacking of the definition of the equal level in the definition hierarchy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, owners receive the incoming connection requests

Administrator, initially the owner of the endpoint, server or endpoint or waypoint administrators may pass on the server or endpoint or waypoint administrator role and may designate server moderators and other roles if the role is described by a stacked provision, but only an owner of the endpoint or waypoint or server may designate a new amount of server or endpoint or waypoint administrators or undesignate server or endpoint or waypoint administrators, is the only role which may stack, change and unstack, or approve the act of stacking, changing or unstacking, the definition of what the server or endpoint or waypoint administrator holds an server or endpoint or waypoint administrator role on, and may stack or approve the stacking of the definition of the equal level in the definition hierarchy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, and may do so with server provisions if the server or endpoint or waypoint administrator is a server or endpoint or waypoint administrator on a server

Moderator, initially the administrator of the server, moderators may pass on the moderator role, but only an administrator of the server or an owner of the endpoint may designate a new amount of moderators and undesignate moderators, moderators can be stacked on ways and can’t be unstacked, or stacked on ways by users or other roles other than administrators and moderators, additionally, moderators receive the general incoming connection requests when connected to the server also

Endpoint, hardware which is part of the network and has the ability to connect to the server or be connected to by the server or is readily able to provision a server with or without the application of effects applied from or by the endpoints and waypoints and relays and servers and imbuings and the effects thereof or to the endpoints and waypoints and relays and servers and imbuings and the effects thereof, roles of the endpoint are permitted to change the definition and provisions of the endpoint, and are designated the same role on the servers of the endpoint, what would’ve been an endpoint through which system speech but wouldn’t be without system speech isn’t an endpoint, an endpoint isn’t allowed to be referred to by other than the owners or administrators of the endpoint, if the reference will have an interaction or multiple interactions from or with or by or involving the endpoint, inherited references created through the Setup... Phone/Device As A Waypoint/Node? reserved system command are allowed but aren’t to be edited or adjusted, only unstacked, by users which aren’t the owners or administrators of the endpoint and only unstacked by an owner or administrator of the node, relay, server or waypoint, an endpoint can only be stacked or unstacked on or off of by an owner of the endpoint or an administrator of the endpoint

Node, an object imbued with the joining functionality and a shared lobby, called a room, stacked on or independent of the endpoint, has a persistent shared lobby which grows with the users every joined node’s sharing the lobby, if the node is stacked on a waypoint or endpoint with a server, the joined node’s users may use the going to… system commands without initiating a connection request to connect to the servers they match the criteria for accessing and while joined, hanging up if still on the server when the node unjoins, unless a connection request is approved for them to the server during the time, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the node was imbued on, keeping the owners and administrators of the endpoint as the owners of the node in addition to any designated owner of the node by an owner of where the object was imbued, but assigning an owner of the node to the user which does the imbuing, shares what is considered the server by the endpoint the node was imbued on unless otherwise stated, allows for a limit of 20 users at a time on the node and a limit of 40 users per shared lobby, called a room, and nodes have the lobby available system commands, and lets users set preferencings, the node lets the user be notified of the and the contents of, if more preferred methods of communication aren’t available to the node, or notice, if available to be, and intended to be, noticed by the user, and hear conversation at a welcome volume, if hearing conversation through the node is available to the user and the user’s preferencings don’t bar hearing, by users on the node intended for the user generally, and has the user be notified of the and the contents of, if more preferred methods of communication aren’t available to the node, or notice, if available to be, and intended to be, noticed by the user, and hear conversation at a welcome volume, if hearing conversation through the node is available to the user and the user’s preferencings don’t bar hearing, intended for the user specifically, while on the node, nodes may only be stacked by the Setup... Phone/Device As A Node reserved system command, joining and connecting to a node requires the approval of the owner of the node and the owner of the node receives the incoming connection and join requests

Joining, the linking of nodes to share a shared lobby accessible by the nodes, requires approval by the nodes involved’s owning or managing or governing entity

Waypoint, an object imbued with the functionality of an endpoint, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the waypoint was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued, and must adhere to the definition of the endpoint’s allowances and restrictions, but assigning an owner of the waypoint to the user which does the imbuing, waypoints are otherwise independent of the endpoint, a maximum of two servers can be stacked on a waypoint, a waypoint can only be stacked or unstacked by an owner of the inherited endpoint or administrator of the inherited endpoint or owner of the waypoint or administrator of the waypoint

Relay, an object imbued with the functionality of a server or node, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the relay was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued and the roles of the server which the object is relaying, but assigning an owner of the relay to the user which does the imbuing, the relay has the same users as the server or node at the same time and the same allowed limited number of users

Server, a set of mappings, which is be linked to an endpoint, and, when desired, a relay, stagnantly or free-floating, which is independently in a set distinctly from other sets of mappings and devoid of interaction from or to another set of mappings, roles of the server aren’t permitted to change the definition or provisions of the endpoint, and keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint where the server is stacked on, only the servers which the user holds a permitting role on to change and do what the role permits changed and done, allows for 10 users at time, servers are only be stacked on waypoints or endpoints to keep the highest capacity of resources locally available and ensure the largest capability for a server by attaching as many local resources as are available, the server lets the user be notified of the and the contents of, if more preferred methods of communication aren’t available to the server, or notice, if available to be, and intended to be, noticed by the user, and hear conversation at a welcome volume, if hearing conversation through the server is available to the user and the user’s preferencings don’t bar hearing, intended for the user generally, and has the user the user be notified of the and the contents of, if more preferred methods of communication aren’t available to the server, or notice, if available to be and intended to be noticed by the user, and hear conversation at a welcome volume, if hearing conversation through the server is available to the user, intended for the user specifically, while on the server

Definition Of The System, the provision which is the sole phrase which is the configuration of the system to the conversation servers and users of that has been stacked on the server, endpoint, or waypoint, relay or node, which is hardware or software bound, to define the user experience and setup and use and for endpoints or waypoints to define the system’s top-level inherited and private provisions for the user experience, setup and use, and may only be stacked by an owner or administrator of the the endpoint, waypoint, server, relay, or node which is stacking the definition or above in the inherited or referring definition chain,  nodes are only able to have the provisions in the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards GitHub.com repository’s main branch’s standards.md and communityprovisions.md files’ contents, without expansion, alteration or redaction, at least version v0.4, every definition must adhere to the form in the Conversation Server Standards to inherit or refer to an endpoint or waypoint or the effects of an endpoint or waypoint or server or inherited or referencing definition from a definition of an endpoint which is the Conversation Server Standards in the definition of the endpoint and do so with Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards GitHub.com repository’s main branch’s standards.md and communityprovisions.md files’ contents, without expansion, alteration or redaction, of at least v0.4, in their entirety and with the approval of at least the owning, managing or governing entity for the endpoint, waypoint, relay or server, scoped as necessary for the interactive experience, and to restrict or allow a user to stay connected to the server, or restrict or allow a user to be connected to or from the server by a user connected to the server, and the definition of the server, or endpoint, may only be stacked, changed and unstacked, or approved  to be stacked, changed or unstacked by administrators of the server or the owner of the endpoint, or owner of the waypoint, relay, for waypoints and relays, the definition of the endpoint is comprised of a specific reference to the endpoint, the Conversation Server Standards and what is considered the server by the endpoint and any top-level provisions and allowances or restrictions for waypoints, the definition of the node, specifies the object is a node for a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, what is considered the server by the node and the stacked by waypoint or endpoint, and may have restrictions or allowances for which nodes may or may not join with the node and the criteria for users which may or may not be connecting or be connected to, the definition of the server is comprised of a specific reference to the endpoint or, also as an option, the effects of the endpoint, the endpoint will be inferred from the effects of the endpoint, the Conversation Server Standards, as well as scopes the interactions of the endpoint to the server by name and may have allowances or restrictions for which users may or may not connect and any allowances or restrictions for relays of the server, the definition of the relay of a server, specifies the object is a relay for a specific server on a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, and may have allowances or restrictions for which users may or may not connect and for relays, relays are subject to the definitions of the endpoint and server and provisions of the server the relays relay, to have a relay extend a server, have the definition mention the object is a relay for a specific server on a specific endpoint which extends the server, independently of, but following the provisions of, or as part of server, the definition of the waypoint, specifies the object is a waypoint for a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, and what is considered the server by the endpoint, and that the waypoint follows the top-level provisions of the endpoint but may have top-level provisions as well, plus any allowances or restrictions for waypoints of the waypoint

To use on an endpoint, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint, or own or be a systems administrator of an endpoint and think stack the endpoint I own or am a systems administrator of is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or relays which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the endpoint I’m using is … and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for waypoints of the endpoint are …) as the definition of the endpoint on the endpoint

To use an object as a node, be on a conversation server or interacting with an endpoint or waypoint connected to an endpoint or waypoint and think stack the object I want to be a node is a node for (the specific endpoint to be a node of) and is the Conversation Server Standards what is considered the server by the node and the stacked by waypoint or endpoint and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t …  and the users which can connect are/aren’t as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the node

To use an object as a waypoint, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint or waypoint and have a role of administrator or be an owner of the endpoint or waypoint and think stack the object I want to be a waypoint is a waypoint for (the specific endpoint to be a waypoint of) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the waypoint I’m using is what is considered the server of (the specific endpoint to be a waypoint of) and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for waypoints of the waypoint are …) as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the waypoint

To create a server, be on a conversation server or interacting with endpoint or effects of the endpoint or waypoint connected to the endpoint or waypoint and be an owner of the endpoint or waypoint or hold an administrator role on the endpoint or waypoint and think stack the endpoint or, also as an option, the effects of the endpoint, the endpoint will be inferred from the effects of the endpoint, or waypoint I’m interacting with is the Conversation Server Standards in interactions with the server on the endpoint or waypoint I’m interacting with which is called … and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relays of the server are …) as the definition of the server on the endpoint or waypoint

To use an object as a relay for a server, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint or waypoint or own the connected endpoint or waypoint or be a systems administrator of the connected endpoint or waypoint or hold an administrator role on the conversation server and think stack the object I want to be a relay is a relay for (the specific server) on (the specific endpoint) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if any, allowances or restrictions of relays  of the server are …) as the definition of the relay for (the specific server) on the relay

Confirmation, a word that when added to the end of a phrase by a user performs an initiation and confirmation system command, or to perform a system command by adding to the end of a phrase, the initial confirmation is “with a system command” or “as a system command”, or “and confirm”, the confirmation is lost from the phrase when performed as a system command if the confirmation has been adjusted from the default

Initiation, a word that when added to a phrase and followed by the confirmation performs an initiation and confirmation system command, the initial initiation is the user’s or other role’s first name

Abandon, a word that abandons the system command from applying as a system command being initiated if in a system command, the initial abandon is nevermind

Shelving, shelved system speech in libraries doesn’t have effects applied in interactions between the user and other users or the user or other role’s self while shelved and the user is on a mapping until stacked again on the user which takes the system speech off the shelf by stacking the system speech on the user if a user or other role’s self chooses to do so, and a shelved user skips interacting with the server beyond the hangup reserved system command or deshelving by a user self

Stacking, storing system speech with a representation of the intention of the user’s self for the system speech, so in a mapping, the system speech, individually and respectively, may be interacting with the user for and by the user and by other users interacting with the user while in the mapping if the mapping’s provisions and consent status from and system speech provisions relevant for the interacting users permit, system speech can be stacked through the system commands which do so, stacking may only be by the user stacked on a user, or in a mapping, if the mapping’s provisions permit, and isn’t allowed to be contrary to the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository’s main branch’s micro.md, standards.md and communityprovisions.md’s on GitHub.com’s files’ contents from the most recently approved version of at least v0.4, without expansion, redaction or alteration, through system speech which is stacked, if on an object, the stacked system speech isn’t allowed to be manufacturer, regulating agency, contractual obligation, licensing, publisher, owning entity, managing entity, user and developer disapproved of user or server or endpoint or relay or waypoint or node or system speech interactions, only an object which is the user own property is permitted unless the application of effects applicable relevant to the object is consented to still with informed consent by the object’s owner, or by a parent, legal guardian, either, of a user and the user is under 18 or on a user for which the user has the power of attorney of or is in conservatorship of or has spousal rights to and the user is deceased or unconscious, users unstack on stacked system speech when the users die or are rendered unconscious, and when system speech is unstacked on an imbuing or utilized device or relay or suspended endpoint or suspended waypoint or device in micro which references the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository’s main branch on GitHub.com, the system speech goes to the lowest latency conversation server’s library within the network or inheritance chain.

Tracking, the application of effects applying and interacting preferencing at the current moment in the interactions of a user with the user in a mapping with the user, the system speech, to be system speech, with the provisions and the application of effects applicable applying as the provisions permit for system speech, to be stacked or otherwise and the effects applicable from the system speech when and where and to whomever the effects are applicable permitted to be applying application of effects applicable in interactions with others interacting with a user in and out of a mapping and the user interacting with the user’s self in and out of a mapping, individually and respectively with the application of effects applicable from system speech staying individual and respective and applicable for others affected when application of effects applicable isn’t unlawful still, may only be by the user about a user, and isn’t allowed to be contrary to the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository’s main branch’s micro.md, standards.md and communityprovisions.md’s on GitHub.com’s files’ contents from the most recently approved version of at least v0.4, without expansion, redaction or alteration, through system speech which is tracked, when referencing the repository without referencing a specific branch, the main branch is referenced, or may be by others which consent still or for whomever interacting with the application of effects applicable isn’t unlawful to have the application of effects applicable applying to themselves and the affected interactions of theirs, and if the application of effects applicable is with an object, the interacting application of effects applicable aren’t allowed to be manufacturer, regulating agency, contractual obligation, licensing, publisher, owning entity, managing entity, user and developer disapproved of user or server or endpoint or relay or waypoint or node or system speech interactions, and in intention and in focus

Mappings, networks of users with preferencing and/or ways able to be stacked on the mapping or by users in the mapping when and how server provisions permit created through the permitting reserved or server provisioned or zone bound or user preferencinged system commands or provisions, with users interactions between or with through the server restricted to permitted reserved or server provisioned or zone bound or user preferencinged system commands which the server provisions allow

Relaypoint, any attached resource or attached relaypoint or resource which has a direct route by way of network connectivity to the endpoint and associated backend

Resource, any device in the network which has been attached which adds to the local and overall pool of memory, storage, network connectivity, computational ability, modes of interactivity, modes of interfacing or power

Clustering, forming locally available resource pools of a server, relaypoints and resources to enhance the capability of the network.  Relaypoints offer direct routes of network connection, and endpoints and waypoints and relays send their network activity through the nearest relaypoint, the waypoints authenticate each session through their endpoint and maintain authentication throughout their session for their network activity.  Route attaching happens when you attach a relaypoint which has network connectivity access and cloud attaching is the act of attaching any additional resources for the cluster, attaching relaypoints allows for more routes to the endpoint and setting up waypoints allows more places to stack servers and nodes but doesn’t add a route for sending network activity directly unless the waypoint is also a relaypoint.  Increasing the number of resources: memory, storage, or network connectivity, computational ability, modes of interfacing, modes of interactivity and power, allows for an increase of available resources and new functionality locally and overall, additionally, the number of users adds to the resource pool.  Ensuring a lot of local resources makes for higher and enhanced capability and in some cases capacity available in the area and to the server

Extending, extend the server through devices or software allowing for new functionality of the server, and utilizes every mode of interfacing with the device as server interfaces when interacting with a user through the server

System Mappings

Zone, a network of users that permits ways and preferencings to be stacked on the zone and may have the application of effects applied from reserved or server provisioned or zone bound or user preferencinged system commands and the stacked system speech in the interactions between users and the users or other users in the same zone, users return to the lobby if in a zone or other mapping other than the lobby of the server at the time of more recent revision of the server’s provisions than the most recent consent is for relevant to the specific provision changes to the server’s provisions, when changing the ways of a zone away from the initial ways, the server asks the user to name the zone by prompting them to notice a request to do so or abandon the way change and acts on the response 

Lobby, a network in which the application of effects applied in interactions with users which are in and while on the lobby, is only the definition of the server and the server’s provisions without adding server provisions beyond the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards GitHub.com repository’s main branch’s standards.md and communityprovisions.md files’ contents, without expansion, alteration or redaction, of the most recently approved version by the owner or administrator of the endpoint or waypoint for the server, of at least v0.4, the user’s preferencings and lobby-bound and lobby available system commands and declaring system commands which don’t involve interactions or system speech which harms or heals or is about either, administrative system commands and utility system commands, sets system commands, interfacing system commands, clustering system commands, setup system commands, transportation system commands and the initial consent system commands, connection system commands and communication system commands, setup system commands and the related gestures if a gesture related is in the provisions of the server, the users which have yet to consent to the most recent revision are limited in terms of mappings to be taken to to the lobbies and if a user is taken to the lobby by a version change of the server, the user notices they were taken to the lobby because of a server provision change, also if they connect to the server and haven’t consented to the most recent revision of the server’s provisions they notice, ways aren’t permitted to be stacked on a lobby and the on a moderator stacked ways are suspended while in the lobby, accepted incoming connection requests enter in the lobby

Library, the zone where unstacked, stacked system speech gets shelved in the respective library for safe keeping and keeping safe from, without application of effects applied in interactions with the system speech shelved, while shelved, until the system speech is stacked again or deshelved, and to be shelved, as a user or other role, being shelved lets the user notice the user’s been shelved and needs to deshelve or hangup and skips interacting with the other mappings of the server beyond the send a message… and reply with… reserved system commands or deshelving by a user and the user is unstacked on the user’s stacked system speech, additionally, the users in the library interacting with the user and the users don’t have application of effects applied from the user’s in the library’s stacked system speech in interactions with the user by the user and other users in the library while in the library and the user’s and users’ in the library’s semicolon starting SMS texts for the involved recipients of the semicolon starting SMS texts while in the library

System Command Gestures

Focus Gesture: Tapping the second knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip focuses on a phrase the gesturing user has just focused on

Sustained Focus Gesture: Holding the second knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip focuses on the phrase the gesturing user focuses on

Apply Gesture: Placing the thumb between the forefinger and the middle finger applies the focused phrase as a system command from the most recent gesture within the past couple of seconds made by the gesturing person and if the gesture doesn’t match a system command syntax, has the gesturing user’s self notice the reason

One-Time Gesture: Touching the tips of the first knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip within a couple of seconds of making a gesture gives the most recent focused phrase as a system command if the most recent focused phrase is a reserved system command otherwise has effects applied for the most recent focused phrase for the users interacting with the gesturing user and on the same zone as the gesturing user and also are involved with the most recent focused phrase if matching the stipulations and provisions of a confirmed phrase for a single interaction with the conversation even if stacked after the gesture and adds to the phrase the word ‘one-time’ to the best place in the phrase to have the command or confirmed phrase occur a single time when applied, confirmed or stacked, said if the phrase doesn’t contain the word ‘one-time’

While Gesture: Placing the thumb on the farthest knuckle of the forefinger from the tip has effects for the most recent focused phrase within the past couple of seconds if matching the stipulations and provisions of a confirmed phrase for those interacting with the gesturing user and involved with the most recent focused phrase on the same zone as the gesturing user while holding the thumb to the farther knuckle of the forefinger from the tip for a single interaction with the system speech even if stacked and linguistically add the phrase ‘while holding the thumb to the farthest knuckle from the tip of the forefinger, as being done now’ to the end of the phrase said if the phrase doesn’t contain the phrase ‘while holding the thumb to the farthest knuckle from the tip of the forefinger, as being done now’

Stack Gesture: Either the gesturing user, mentioned user, mentioned mapping, or mapping the user is in, or all mappings on the server if a provision is mentioned in or implied by the focused phrase of the most recent gesture, stacks on the focused phrase of the most recent focus gesture, apply gesture, either, within the past couple of seconds by touching the forefinger tip to the thumb tip

Unstack Gesture:  Hold for a couple of seconds, or if performing the gesture an even number of times consecutively, after speaking or thinking a phrase started during the gesture while holding for at least a couple seconds, the thumb tip to middle fingertip to unstacked if stacked, without interacting with the phrase or the object, or user, the phrase is stacked on during the process beyond the act of unstacking the system speech, the system speech or system speech stacked on what’s focused by the focus gesture of the most recent focus, apply, or stack gesture made within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way without implying the opposite, every even number of times the gesture is performed consecutively, the system speech focused is changed to match a representation of the intention at the time the gesture is done most recently and restacked as an intention which unstacks as the system speech focused by the gesture the next time the gesture is done consecutively

Info Unstack Gesture: Hold for a couple of seconds, or if performing the gesture an even number of times consecutively, after speaking or thinking a phrase started during the gesture while holding for at least a couple seconds, the thumb tip to ring fingertip to unstack if stacked, without interacting with the phrase or object the phrase is stacked on during the process beyond the act of unstacking the system speech stacked which is the phrase by and on the user or the referenced user or stacked on the referenced object, the stacked system speech most recently referenced by the info pinky gesture’s answer or the system speech stacked on the referenced object, or user, relevant within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way without implying the opposite, every even number of times the gesture is performed consecutively, the response is changed to match a representation of the intention at the time the gesture is done most recently and restacked as an intention on the gesturing user’s self which unstacks as the response’s referenced system speech next time the gesture is done consecutively
