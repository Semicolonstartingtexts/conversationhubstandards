System Talk

Intentions, the conversation that has been had or being had by a user with a representation of the user intentions for the conversation

Comments, the conversation that has been had or being had by or on or to the user with a representation of the intention of a user which isn’t the user’s own self and which had the conversation

Provisions, the conversation which governs the interactions between the connected users of the server and the server, stacks ubiquitously on the mappings and stays updated and consistent when changes occur to the provision on any of the mappings and may restrict which users are options for the connecting to the server or being connected to by the server or a user on the server and when the users may be connected, may be stacked, changed and unstacked only by an administrator of the server

Preferences, the conversation which governs the server’s interactions regarding the user in their interactions with the user, set and stacked only by the user and only on the user, or on a mapping, if the mapping’s provisions permit, preferences, can’t be unstacked by other users than a user’s own self 

Rules, the stacked conversation which limits or enhances any user which is in the zone’s interactions with the other users which are in the zone the user in, may only be stacked on mappings and roles which permit rules to be stacked, and aren’t allowed to be intending to the source of physically harm, hurt, injury, pain, decline in health or overabundance of health beyond a user preferred threshold defaulting to a threshold of comfort ensured, to render unconscious, comatose, deceased or to suppress or limit the consciousness of, a user, or enhance or limit in such a way as to be hindering of the conscious independence of a user, or the limit the ability to communicate independently and to do so without alteration from the intended independently generated intent for the user’s own communication being the message communicated through whichever medium the message is communicated

Confirmed Phrase and Confirmed Phrases, the most recent phrase made by a user which aren’t stacked and have been confirmed by a user in the user interactions for the user and users relevant to the interaction if the mapping’s provisions permit, a user is always stacked on the most recent confirmed phrase by the user for the user unless explicitly or generally unstacked

Sets, groups of stacked intentions for the user which can be swapped out in full, have phrases added to and removed from, built from specific phrases, or stacked and unstacked as a whole

System Command Talk

Declarations, system talk given with a system command, system talk which is focused on, may only be a reserved system command or declared in a provision, may be given in any language which has words for the same words which are in the requisite phrasing to give the system command with words which share a definition or have shared definitions to the phrase’s words

Interactions, applicable with an apply system command only may be a reserved system command given with a system command, may be a system command gesture performed verbally given in a system command, or otherwise performed and may be declared in a provision, noticing is always done in the most natural and preferred language of the user for the system and the user notices the reason why an interaction doesn’t occur if isn’t allowed or permitted using properly the explicit notice wording of the provision if such wording is in the provisions

System Setup

Server Provisions, the set of provisions that outlines a way all users of a server may interact with the server, the rest of the provisions of the server aren’t allowed priority over the Conversation Server Standards and the definition of the endpoint, relaypoint, server, extension, relay, node, whichever is the most relevant to the provision, and the provisions of the Conversations Server Standards aren’t permitted to be unstacked in less than entirety or altered and aren't permitted to be opted out of or opted in to except in entirety, as well as system talk can't be stacked, applied or confirmed about the Conversation Server Standards except opt-in, opt-out preferences, as well as use of the provisions therein

User, is provisioned as a person interacting with the server or an application of the effects applicable relevant to the server’s users, the default role of the server’s population beyond the owner of the endpoint, in interactions through a server or nodes, we understand each other in our native language

Owner, the owner of the relaypoint, relay, node or the endpoint, without an administrator role, may stack or approve the stacking of the definition of the equal level in the definition hierarchy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, owners receive the incoming connection requests for the server also

Administrator, initially the owner of the endpoint, administrators may pass on the administrator role and may designate moderators and other roles if the role is described by a stacked provision, but only an owner of the endpoint may designate a new amount of administrators or undesignate administrators, is the only role which may stack, change and unstack, or approve the act of stacking, changing or unstacking, the definition of what the administrator holds an administrator role on, and may stack or approve the stacking of the definition of the equal level in the definition hierarchy downwards on the hierarchy for themselves or others, and may do so with server provisions if the administrator is an administrator on a server, connected to the server administrators receive the general incoming connection requests also

Moderator, initially the administrator of the server, moderators may pass on the moderator role, but only an administrator of the server or an owner of the endpoint may designate a new amount of moderators and undesignate moderators, moderators can be stacked on rules and can’t be unstacked, or stacked on rules by users or other roles other than administrators and moderators, additionally, moderators receive the general incoming connection requests when connected to the server also

Doorkeep, receive general incoming connection requests when aren’t connected also, may be designated or undesignated by the owner of the endpoint or administrators or moderators of the server

Endpoint, hardware which is or can connected to and is or can be connected to by the server or can provision a server, with and without current and previous system talk, system commands, and the server’s user current and previous interactions with the server and current and previous use of the server, and also despite current and previous system talk, system commands, and the server’s user current and previous interactions with the server and current and previous use of the server, roles of the endpoint are permitted to change the definition and provisions of the endpoint, and are designated the same role on the servers of the endpoint, what would’ve been an endpoint through system talk but wouldn’t be without system talk isn’t an endpoint

Node, an object imbued with the joining functionality and a shared lobby, called a room, stacked on or independent of the endpoint, has a persistent shared lobby which grows with the users every joined node’s sharing the lobby, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the node was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued, but assigning an owner of the node to the user which does the imbuing, shares what is considered the server by the endpoint the node was imbued on unless otherwise stated, allows for a limit of 20 users at a time on the node and a limit of 40 users per shared lobby, called a room, and nodes have the lobby available system commands but don’t have utility system commands available

Joining, the linking of nodes to share a shared lobby, and to be taken to the zones or lobbies of a server, the server definition must allow or at least mustn’t have a restriction against the criteria the user matches, being taken to the originating server’s lobby when unjoining

Relaypoint, an object imbued with the functionality of an endpoint, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the relaypoint was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued, and must adhere to the definition of the endpoint’s allowances and restrictions, but assigning an owner of the relaypoint to the user which does the imbuing, relaypoints are otherwise independent of the endpoint

Relay, an object imbued with the functionality of a server or node, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the relay was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued and the roles of the server which the object is relaying, but assigning an owner of the relay to the user which does the imbuing, the relay has the same users as the server or node at the same time and the same allowed limited number of users

Server, a set of mappings, which is be linked to an endpoint, and, when desired, a relay, stagnantly or free-floating, which is independently in a set distinctly from other sets of mappings and devoid of interaction from or to another set of mappings, roles of the server aren’t permitted to change the definition or provisions of the endpoint, and keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint where the server is stacked on, only the servers which the user holds a permitting role on to change and do what the role permits changed and done, allows for 10 users at time, servers should only be stacked on waypoints to keep the highest capacity of resources locally available and ensure the largest capability for a server by attaching as many local resources as are available

Definition, the provision which is the sole phrase that has been stacked on the server, endpoint, or relaypoint, to define the server’s provisions for setup and use or endpoint to define the endpoint’s servers setup and top-level server, relaypoint and endpoint provisions for setup and use, and may only be stacked by an owner or administrator of the the endpoint, relaypoint, server, relay, or node which is stacking the definition or above in the inherited or referring definition chain,  nodes are only able to have the provisions in the Conversation Server Standards, every definition must adhere to the form in the Conversation Server Standards to inherit or refer to an endpoint or inherited or referencing definition from a definition of an endpoint which is the Conversation Server Standards in the definition of the endpoint and do so without adjustment of the Conversation Server Standards in the current version from the main branch of the Semicolonstartingtexts/conversationserverstandards repository on GitHub.com from use of in their entirety without adjustment, scoped as necessary for the interactive experience, and to restrict or allow a user to stay connected to the server, or restrict or allow a user to be connected to or from the server by a user connected to the server, and the definition of the server, or endpoint, may only be stacked, changed and unstacked, or approved  to be stacked, changed or unstacked by administrators of the server or the owner of the endpoint, or owner of the relaypoint, relay, or extension, for relaypoints and relays, the definition of the endpoint is comprised of a specific reference to the endpoint, the Conversation Server Standards and what is considered the server by the endpoint and any top-level provisions and allowances or restrictions for relaypoints, the definition of the node, specifies the object is a node for a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, what is considered the server by the node and the stacked by relaypoint or endpoint, and may have restrictions or allowances for which nodes may or may not join with the node and the criteria for users which may or may not be connecting or be connected to, the definition of the server is comprised of a specific reference to the endpoint or, also as an option, the effects of the endpoint, the endpoint will be inferred from the effects of the endpoint, the Conversation Server Standards, as well as scopes the interactions of the endpoint to the server by name and may have allowances or restrictions for which users may or may not connect and any allowances or restrictions for relays of the server, the definition of the relay of a server, specifies the object is a relay for a specific server on a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, and may have allowances or restrictions for which users may or may not connect and for relays, relays are subject to the definitions of the endpoint and server and provisions of the server the relays relay, to have a relay extend a server, have the definition mention the object is a relay for a specific server on a specific endpoint which extends the server, independently of, but following the provisions of, or as part of server, the definition of the relaypoint, specifies the object is a relaypoint for a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, and what is considered the server by the endpoint, and that the relaypoint follows the top-level provisions of the endpoint but may have top-level provisions as well, plus any allowances or restrictions for relaypoints of the relaypoint

To use on an endpoint, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint, or own or be a systems administrator of an endpoint and think stack the endpoint I own or am a systems administrator of is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or relays which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the endpoint I’m using is … and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relaypoints of the endpoint are …) as the definition of the endpoint on the endpoint

To use an object as a node, be on a conversation server or interacting with an endpoint or relaypoint connected to an endpoint or relaypoint and think stack the object I want to be a node is a node for (the specific endpoint to be a node of) and is the Conversation Server Standards what is considered the server by the node and the stacked by relaypoint or endpoint and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t …  and the users which can connect are/aren’t as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the node

To use an object as a relaypoint, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint or relaypoint and have a role of administrator or be an owner of the endpoint or relaypoint and think stack the object I want to be a relaypoint is a relaypoint for (the specific endpoint to be a relaypoint of) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the relaypoint I’m using is what is considered the server of (the specific endpoint to be a relaypoint of) and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relaypoints of the relaypoint are …) as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the relaypoint

To create a server, be on a conversation server or interacting with endpoint or effects of the endpoint or relaypoint connected to the endpoint or relaypoint and be an owner of the endpoint or relaypoint or hold an administrator role on the endpoint or relaypoint and think stack the endpoint or, also as an option, the effects of the endpoint, the endpoint will be inferred from the effects of the endpoint, or relaypoint I’m interacting with is the Conversation Server Standards in interactions with the server on the endpoint or relaypoint I’m interacting with which is called … and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relays of the server are …) as the definition of the server on the endpoint or relaypoint

To use an object as a relay for a server, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint or relaypoint or own the connected endpoint or relaypoint or be a systems administrator of the connected endpoint or relaypoint or hold an administrator role on the conversation server and think stack the object I want to be a relay is a relay for (the specific server) on (the specific endpoint) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if any, allowances or restrictions of relays  of the server are …) as the definition of the relay for (the specific server) on the relay

Confirmation, a word that when added to the end of a phrase by a user performs an initiation and confirmation system command, or to perform a system command by adding to the end of a phrase, the initial confirmation is “with a system command” or “as a system command”

Initiation, a word that when added to a phrase and followed by the confirmation performs an initiation and confirmation system command, the initial initiation is the user’s or other role’s first name

Shelving, shelved system talk in libraries doesn’t have effects applied in interactions between the user and other users or the user or other role’s self while shelved and the user is on a mapping until stacked again on the user which takes the system talk off the shelf by stacking the system talk on the user if a user or other role’s self chooses to do so, and a shelved user skips interacting with the server beyond the hangup reserved system command or deshelving by a user self

Stacking, storing system talk with a representation of the intention of the user’s self for the system talk, so in a mapping, the system talk, individually and respectively, may be interacting with the user for and by the user and by other users interacting with the user while in the mapping if the mapping’s provisions and consent status from and system talk provisions relevant for the interacting users permit, system talk can be stacked through the system commands which do so, stacking may only be by the user stacked on a user, or in a mapping, if the mapping’s provisions permit, if on an object, only an object which is the user own property is permitted unless the application of effects applicable relevant to the object is consented to still with informed consent by the object’s owner, or by a parent, legal guardian, either, of a user and the user is under 18 or on a user for which the user has the power of attorney of, users unstack on stacked system talk when the users die or are rendered unconscious

Tracking, the application of effects applying at the current moment in the interactions of a user with the user in a mapping with the user, the system talk, to be system talk, with the provisions and the application of effects applicable applying as the provisions permit for system talk, to be stacked or otherwise and the effects applicable from the system talk when and where and to whomever the effects are applicable permitted to be applying application of effects applicable in interactions with others interacting with a user in and out of a mapping and the user interacting with the user’s self in and out of a mapping, individually and respectively with the application of effects applicable from system talk staying individual and respective and applicable for others affected when application of effects applicable isn’t unlawful still, may only be by the user about a user, or others which consent still or for whomever interacting with the application of effects applicable isn’t unlawful to have the application of effects applicable applying to themselves and the affected interactions of theirs

Mappings, networks of users with preferences and/or rules able to be stacked on the mapping or by users in the mapping when and how server provisions permit created through the permitting reserved or server provisioned system commands or provisions, with users interactions between or with through the server restricted to permitted reserved or server provisioned system commands which the server provisions allow

Waypoint, any appropriated resource or declared relaypoint or resource which has a direct route by way of network connectivity to the endpoint and associated backend

Resource, any device in the network which has been appropriated which adds to the local and overall pool of memory, storage, network connectivity or power

Clustering, forming local cells of a Waypoint, Relaypoints and Resources to enhance the capability of the network.  Waypoints offer direct routes of network connection, and relaypoints send their network activity through the nearest waypoint, the waypoints authenticate each session through their endpoint and maintain authentication throughout their session for their network activity.  Route attaching happens when you declare a relaypoint which has network connectivity access and cloud attaching is the act of appropriating any additional resources for the cluster, declaring relaypoints allows for more routes to the waypoint and more places to stack servers and nodes but doesn’t add a route for sending network activity directly.  Increasing the number of resources: memory, storage, or network connectivity, and power, allows for an increase of potency to capability locally and overall, additionally, the number of users adds to the resource pool.  Ensuring a lot of local resources makes for higher and enhanced capability and capacity available in the area.

System Mappings

Zone, a network of users that permits rules and preferences to be stacked on the zone and may have the application of effects applied from reserved or server provisioned system commands and the stacked system talk in the interactions between users and the users or other users in the same zone, users return to the lobby if in a zone or other mapping other than the lobby of the server at the time of more recent revision of the server’s provisions than the most recent consent is for relevant to the specific provision changes to the server’s provisions, when changing the rules of a zone away from the initial rules, the server asks the user to name the zone by prompting them to notice a request to do so or abandon the rule change and acts on the response 

Lobby, a network in which the application of effects applied in interactions with users which are in and while on the lobby, is only the definition of the server and the server’s provisions, administrative system commands and utility system commands, transportation system commands and the initial consent system commands, connection system commands and communication system commands, setup system commands and the related gestures if a gesture related is in the provisions of the server, the users which have yet to consent to the most recent revision are limited in terms of mappings to be taken to to the lobbies, rules aren’t permitted to be stacked on a lobby and the on a moderator stacked rules are suspended while in the lobby, accepted incoming connection requests enter in the lobby

Library, the zone where unstacked, stacked system talk gets shelved in the respective library for safe keeping and keeping safe from, without application of effects applied in interactions with the system talk shelved, while shelved, until the system talk is stacked again or deshelved, and to be shelved, as a user or other role, skips interacting with the server beyond the goodbye reserved system command or deshelving by a user, additionally, the users in the library interacting with the user and the users don’t have application of effects applied from the user’s in the library’s stacked system talk in interactions with the user by the user and other users in the library while in the library and the user’s and users’ in the library’s semicolon starting SMS texts for the involved recipients of the semicolon starting SMS texts while in the library

System Command Gestures

Focus Gesture: Tapping the second knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip focuses on a phrase the gesturing user has just focused on

Sustained Focus Gesture: Holding the second knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip focuses on the phrase the gesturing user focuses on

Apply Gesture: Placing the thumb between the forefinger and the middle finger applies the focused phrase as a system command from the most recent gesture within the past couple of seconds made by the gesturing person and if the gesture doesn’t match a system command syntax, has the gesturing user’s self notice the reason

One-Time Gesture: Touching the tips of the first knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip within a couple of seconds of making a gesture gives the most recent focused phrase as a system command if the most recent focused phrase is a reserved system command otherwise has effects applied for the most recent focused phrase for the users interacting with the gesturing user and on the same zone as the gesturing user and also are involved with the most recent focused phrase if matching the stipulations and provisions of a confirmed phrase for a single interaction with the conversation even if stacked after the gesture and adds to the phrase the word ‘one-time’ to the best place in the phrase to have the command or confirmed phrase occur a single time when applied, confirmed or stacked, said if the phrase doesn’t contain the word ‘one-time’

While Gesture: Placing the thumb on the farthest knuckle of the forefinger from the tip has effects for the most recent focused phrase within the past couple of seconds if matching the stipulations and provisions of a confirmed phrase for those interacting with the gesturing user and involved with the most recent focused phrase on the same zone as the gesturing user while holding the thumb to the farther knuckle of the forefinger from the tip for a single interaction with the system talk even if stacked and linguistically add the phrase ‘while holding the thumb to the farthest knuckle from the tip of the forefinger, as being done now’ to the end of the phrase said if the phrase doesn’t contain the phrase ‘while holding the thumb to the farthest knuckle from the tip of the forefinger, as being done now’

Stack Gesture: Either the gesturing user, mentioned user, mentioned mapping, or mapping the user is in, or all mappings on the server if a provision is mentioned in or implied by the focused phrase of the most recent gesture, stacks on the focused phrase of the most recent focus gesture, apply gesture, either, within the past couple of seconds by touching the forefinger tip to the thumb tip

Unstack Gesture:  Hold for a couple of seconds, or if performing the gesture an even number of times consecutively, after speaking or thinking a phrase started during the gesture while holding for at least a couple seconds, the thumb tip to middle fingertip to unstacked if stacked, without interacting with the phrase during the process beyond the act of unstacking, the system talk focused by the focus gesture of the most recent focus, apply, or stack gesture made within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way without implying the opposite, every even number of times the gesture is performed consecutively, the system talk focused is changed to match a representation of the intention at the time the gesture is done most recently and restacked as an intention which unstacks as the system talk focused by the gesture the next time the gesture is done consecutively

Info Unstack Gesture: Hold for a couple of seconds, or if performing the gesture an even number of times consecutively, after speaking or thinking a phrase started during the gesture while holding for at least a couple seconds, the thumb tip to ring fingertip to unstack if stacked, without interacting with the phrase during the process beyond the act of unstacking, the stacked system talk most recently referenced by the info pinky gesture’s answer within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way without implying the opposite, every even number of times the gesture is performed consecutively, the response is changed to match a representation of the intention at the time the gesture is done most recently and restacked as an intention on the gesturing user’s self which unstacks as the response’s referenced system talk next time the gesture is done consecutively

Utility System Command Gestures

Info Gesture: Touch the thumb tip to the tip of the pinky to ask questions of the server about the server’s status and receive information from the server about by the gesturing user’s self noticing the response

Home Gesture: Tap the thumbs together two times within a second to return, making if returning for the first time, to a zone with preferences of a comfortable applications of the effects applicable of system talk and semicolon starting SMS texts as well as the level and privacy for sharing of location and the rules of and the zone can’t be interacted with other than by the zone’s intended occupying user’s self, which the zone is created for and made by, all users which aren’t the user’s self can’t be in the zone, the user notices to look up the latest version of the system stuff at semicolonstartingtexts.tumblr.com and give I consent to use the most recent revision as a system command before going elsewhere than the lobby on the server, other rules aren’t stacked on home zones and are unstacked if have been or are stacked on home zones

Share & Accept Gestures:  An extended open palm with a description of what to share proposes sharing of system talk the user has interacted with, the palm closing user, or any of a group of palm closing users to be shared to close their palm into a fist to accept the proposed to be shared is stacked by the palm closing users if the palm closing users close their palm while the open palm user is intending to share the system talk

Declaring System Commands

An initiation and confirmation, if set, perform the rest of the phrase minus the confirmation as a system command if the phrase ends with the user’s confirmation given by the user and the phrase fits a reserved system command or a provision system command syntax, and confirms the phrase, for the user and users relevant to the application of effects applicable if those have consented still to the application of effects applicable and limited to a user or a parent, legal guardian, either, of the user which is a user under 18 or a user for which the user has the power of attorney of if and while the listed user has consented still to the application of effects applicable if the phrase doesn’t fit a reserved system command or a provision system command syntax if the phrase contains the initiation and the phrase still ends with the user’s confirmation given by the user

Focus/focused and… gives the rest of the phrase minus the words focus and as a system command if the phrase fits a reserved system command syntax and the phrase ends with the confirmation and confirms the phrase for the user’s self and users relevant to the application of effects applicable if those have consented still to the application of effects applicable if the phrase doesn’t fit a reserved system command syntax

Amend… with… if given as a system command and a reference to a stacked system talk phrase is made adds the phrase which is described by what follows the word with to the end of the stacked conversation referenced, if exact wording is given then to the exact words given for the part of the phrase which is intended to be amended
