Reading the outline above is sufficient knowledge of the Conversation Server Standards to be considered sufficient informed consent of the provisions described therein in the mappings of a server which utilizes the provisions described in the definition of the server

System Talk

Intentioned Phrases, the conversation that has been had or being had by a user with a representation of the user intentions for the conversation

Comments, the conversation that has been had or being had by or on or to the user with a representation of the intention of a user which isn’t the user’s own self and which had the conversation

Provisions, the conversation which governs the interactions between the connected users of the server and the server, stacks ubiquitously on the mappings and stays updated and consistent when changes occur to the provision on any of the mappings and may restrict which users are options for the connecting to the server or being connected to by the server or a user on the server and when the users may be connected, may be stacked, changed and unstacked only by an administrator of the server

Preferences, the conversation which governs the server’s interactions regarding the user in their interactions with the user, set and stacked only by the user and only on the user, or on a mapping, if the mapping’s provisions permit, preferences, can’t be unstacked by other users than a user’s own self 

Rules, the stacked conversation which limits or enhances any user which is in the zone’s interactions with the other users which are in the zone the user in, may only be stacked on mappings and roles which permit rules to be stacked, and aren’t allowed to be intending to the source of physically harm, hurt, injury, pain, decline in health or overabundance of health beyond a user preferred threshold defaulting to a threshold of comfort ensured, to render unconscious, comatose, deceased or to suppress or limit the consciousness of, a user, or enhance or limit in such a way as to be hindering of the conscious independence of a user, or the limit the ability to communicate independently and to do so without alteration from the intended independently generated intent for the user’s own communication being the message communicated through whichever medium the message is communicated

Confirmed Phrase and Confirmed Phrases, the most recent phrase made by a user which aren’t stacked and have been confirmed by a user in the user interactions for the user and users relevant to the interaction if the mapping’s provisions permit, a user is always stacked on the most recent confirmed phrase by the user for the user unless explicitly or generally unstacked

System Command Talk

Declarations, system talk given with a system command, system talk which is focused on, may only be a reserved system command or declared in a provision, may be given in any language which has words for the same words which are in the requisite phrasing to give the system command with words which share a definition or have shared definitions to the phrase’s words

Interactions, applicable with an apply system command only may be a reserved system command given with a system command, may be a system command gesture performed verbally given in a system command, or otherwise performed and may be declared in a provision, noticing is always done in the most natural and preferred language of the user for the system and the user notices the reason why an interaction doesn’t occur if isn’t allowed or permitted using properly the explicit notice wording of the provision if such wording is in the provisions

System Setup

Server Provisions, the set of provisions that outlines a way all users of a server may interact with the server, the rest of the provisions of the server aren’t allowed priority over the Conversation Server Standards and the definition of the endpoint, relaypoint, server, extension, relay, node, whichever is the most relevant to the provision, and the provisions of the Conversations Server Standards aren’t permitted to be unstacked in less than entirety or altered

User, is provisioned as a person interacting with the server or an application of the effects applicable relevant to the server’s users, the default role of the server’s population beyond the owner of the endpoint

Administrator, initially the owner of the endpoint, administrators may pass on the administrator role and may designate moderators and other roles if the role is described by a stacked provision, but only an owner of the endpoint may designate a new amount of administrators or undesignate administrators, is the only role which may stack, change and unstack the definition of the server and provisions, administrators receive the general incoming connection requests when there aren’t moderators connected

Moderator, initially the administrator of the server, moderators may pass on the moderator role, but only an administrator of the server or an owner of the endpoint may designate a new amount of moderators and undesignate moderators, moderators can be stacked on rules and can’t be unstacked, or stacked on rules by users or other roles other than administrators and moderators, additionally, moderators receive the general incoming connection requests when connected

Doorkeep, receive general incoming connection requests when aren’t connected also, may be designated or undesignated by the owner of the endpoint or administrators or moderators of the server

Endpoint, hardware which is or can connected to and is or can be connected to by the server or can provision a server, with and without current and previous system talk, system commands, and the server’s user current and previous interactions with the server and current and previous use of the server, and also despite current and previous system talk, system commands, and the server’s user current and previous interactions with the server and current and previous use of the server, roles of the endpoint are permitted to change the definition and provisions of the endpoint, and are designated the same role on the servers of the endpoint, what would’ve been an endpoint through system talk but wouldn’t be without system talk isn’t an endpoint

Node, an object imbued with the joining functionality and a shared lobby stacked on or independent of the endpoint, has a persistent shared lobby which grows with the users every joined node’s sharing the lobby, being taken to the originating node or server lobby for the users connection when unjoining, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the node was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued, but assigning an owner of the node to the user which does the imbuing, shares what is considered the server by the endpoint the node was imbued on unless otherwise stated, allows for 6 users at a time

Joining, the linking of nodes to share a shared lobby, and to be taken to the zones or lobbies of a server, the server definition must allow or at least mustn’t have a restriction against the criteria the user matches, being taken to the originating server’s lobby when unjoining

Relaypoint, an object imbued with the functionality of an endpoint, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the relay was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued, and must adhere to the definition of the endpoint’s allowances and restrictions, but assigning an owner of the relay to the user which does the imbuing, relaypoints are otherwise independent of the endpoint

Relay, an object imbued with the functionality of a server, the imbuing is tracked by the endpoint the relay was imbued on, keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint of where the object was imbued and the roles of the server which the object is relaying, but assigning an owner of the relay to the user which does the imbuing, the relay has the same users as the server at the same time and the same allowed limited number of users

Server, a set of mappings, which is be linked to an endpoint, and, when desired, a relay, stagnantly or free-floating, which is independently in a set distinctly from other sets of mappings and devoid of interaction from or to another set of mappings, roles of the server aren’t permitted to change the definition or provisions of the endpoint, and keeping the owner and roles of the endpoint where the server is stacked on, only the servers which the user holds a permitting role on to change and do what the role permits changed and done, allows for 10 users at time

Definition, the provision which is the sole phrase that has been stacked on the server, endpoint, or relaypoint, to define the server’s provisions for setup and use or endpoint to define the endpoint’s servers setup and top-level server provisions for setup and use, scoped as necessary for the interactive experience, and to restrict or allow a user to stay connected to the server, or restrict or allow a user to be connected to or from the server by a user connected to the server, and the definition of the server, or endpoint, may only be stacked, changed and unstacked by administrators of the server or the owner of the endpoint, or owner of the relaypoint, relay, or extension, for relaypoints and relays, the definition of the endpoint is comprised of a specific reference to the endpoint, the Conversation Server Standards and what is considered the server by the endpoint and any top-level provisions and allowances or restrictions for relaypoints, the definition of the node, specifies the object is a node for a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, and may have restrictions or allowances for which nodes may or may not join with the node and the criteria for users which may or may not be connecting or be connected to, the definition of the server is comprised of a specific reference to the endpoint, the Conversation Server Standards, as well as scopes the interactions of the endpoint to the server by name and may have allowances or restrictions for which users may or may not connect and any allowances or restrictions for relays of the server, the definition of the relay of a server, specifies the object is a relay for a specific server on a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, and may have allowances or restrictions for which users may or may not connect and for relays, relays are subject to the definitions of the endpoint and server and provisions of the server the relays relay, to have a relay extend a server, have the definition mention the object is a relay for a specific server on a specific endpoint which extends the server, independently of, but following the provisions of, or as part of server, the definition of the relaypoint, specifies the object is a relaypoint for a specific endpoint, is the Conversation Server Standards, and what is considered the server by the endpoint, and that the relaypoint follows the top-level provisions of the endpoint but may have top-level provisions as well, plus any allowances or restrictions for relaypoints of the relaypoint

Confirmation, a word that when added to the end of a phrase by a user performs an initiation and confirmation system command, the initial confirmation is “with a system command”

Initiation, a word that when added to a phrase and followed by the confirmation performs an initiation and confirmation system command, the initial initiation is the user’s or other role’s first name

Shelving, shelved system talk in libraries doesn’t have effects applied in interactions between the user and other users or the user or other role’s self while shelved and the user is on a mapping until stacked again on the user which takes the system talk off the shelf by stacking the system talk on the user if a user or other role’s self chooses to do so, and a shelved user skips interacting with the server beyond the hangup reserved system command or deshelving by a user self

Stacking, storing system talk with a representation of the intention of the user’s self for the system talk, so in a mapping, the system talk may be interacting with the user and be interacting with other users in interactions with the user while in the mapping if the mapping’s provisions and consent status from and system talk provisions relevant for the interacting users permit, system talk can be stacked through the system commands which do so,  stacking may only be by the user stacked on a user, or in a mapping, if the mapping’s provisions permit, if on an object, only an object which is the user own property is permitted unless the application of effects applicable relevant to the object is consented to still with informed consent by the object’s owner, or by a parent, legal guardian, either, of a user and the user is under 18 or on a user for which the user has the power of attorney of

Tracking, the application of effects applying at the current moment in the interactions of a user with the user or/and other users in a mapping with the user, the system talk, to be system talk, with the provisions and the application of effects applicable applying as the provisions permit for system talk, to be stacked or otherwise permitted to be applying application of effects applicable in interactions with users interacting with a user in a mapping, may only be by the user about a user, or other users which consent still to the application of effects applicable applying, if about an object, only an object which is the user’s own property is permitted unless the application of effects applicable relevant to the object is consented to still with informed consent by the object’s owner, or by a parent, legal guardian, either, of a user and the user is under 18 or on a user for which the user has the power of attorney of

Mappings, networks of users with preferences and/or rules able to be stacked on the mapping or by users in the mapping when and how server provisions permit created through the permitting reserved or server provisioned system commands or provisions, with users interactions between or with through the server restricted to permitted reserved or server provisioned system commands which the server provisions allow

System Mappings

Zone, a network of users that permits rules and preferences to be stacked on the zone and may have the application of effects applied from reserved or server provisioned system commands and the stacked system talk in the interactions between users and the users or other users in the same zone, users return to the lobby if in a zone or other mapping other than the lobby of the server at the time of more recent revision of the server’s provisions than the most recent consent is for relevant to the specific provision changes to the server’s provisions

Lobby, a network in which the application of effects applied in interactions with users which are in and while on the lobby, is only the definition of the server and the server’s provisions, administrative system commands and utility system commands, transportation system commands and the initial consent system commands, connection system commands and communication system commands, and the related gestures if a gesture related is in the provisions of the server, the users which have yet to consent to the most recent revision are limited in terms of mappings to be taken to to the lobbies, rules aren’t permitted to be stacked on a lobby and the on a moderator stacked rules are suspended while in the lobby, accepted incoming connection requests enter in the lobby

Library, the zone where unstacked, stacked system talk gets shelved in the respective library for safe keeping and keeping safe from, without application of effects applied in interactions with the system talk shelved, while shelved, until the system talk is stacked again or deshelved, and to be shelved, as a user or other role, skips interacting with the server beyond the goodbye reserved system command or deshelving by a user, additionally, the users in the library interacting with the user and the users don’t have application of effects applied from the user, users in the library’s stacked system talk in interactions with the user in the library while in the library and the user’s and users’ in the library’s semicolon starting SMS texts while in the library

System Command Gestures

Focus Gesture: Tapping the second knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip focuses on a phrase the gesturing user has just focused on

Sustained Focus Gesture: Holding the second knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip focuses on the phrase the gesturing user focuses on

Apply Gesture: Placing the thumb between the forefinger and the middle finger applies the focused phrase as a system command from the most recent gesture within the past couple of seconds made by the gesturing person and if the gesture doesn’t match a system command syntax, has the gesturing user’s self notice the reason

One-Time Gesture: Touching the tips of the first knuckle back from the tip of the forefinger with the thumb tip within a couple of seconds of making a gesture gives the most recent focused phrase as a system command if the most recent focused phrase is a reserved system command otherwise has effects applied for the most recent focused phrase for the users interacting with the gesturing user and on the same zone as the gesturing user and also are involved with the most recent focused phrase if matching the stipulations and provisions of a confirmed phrase for a single interaction with the conversation even if stacked after the gesture and adds to the phrase the word ‘one-time’ to the best place in the phrase to have the command or confirmed phrase occur a single time when applied, confirmed or stacked, said if the phrase doesn’t contain the word ‘one-time’

While Gesture: Placing the thumb on the farthest knuckle of the forefinger from the tip has effects for the most recent focused phrase within the past couple of seconds if matching the stipulations and provisions of a confirmed phrase for those interacting with the gesturing user and involved with the most recent focused phrase on the same zone as the gesturing user while holding the thumb to the farther knuckle of the forefinger from the tip for a single interaction with the system talk even if stacked and linguistically add the phrase ‘while holding the thumb to the farthest knuckle from the tip of the forefinger, as being done now’ to the end of the phrase said if the phrase doesn’t contain the phrase ‘while holding the thumb to the farthest knuckle from the tip of the forefinger, as being done now’

Stack Gesture: Either the gesturing user, mentioned user, mentioned mapping, or mapping the user is in, or all mappings on the server if a provision is mentioned in or implied by the focused phrase of the most recent gesture, stacks on the focused phrase of the most recent focus gesture, apply gesture, either, within the past couple of seconds by touching the forefinger tip to the thumb tip

Unstack Gesture:  Hold for a couple of seconds the thumb tip to middle fingertip to unstacked if stacked, without interacting with the phrase during the process beyond the act of unstacking, the system talk focused by the focus gesture of the most recent focus, apply, or stack gesture made within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way without implying the opposite, every even number of times the gesture is performed consecutively, the system talk focused is changed to match a representation of the intention at the time the gesture is done most recently and restacked as an intentioned phrase which unstacks as the system talk focused by the gesture the next time the gesture is done consecutively

Info Unstack Gesture: Hold for a couple of seconds the thumb tip to ring fingertip to unstack if stacked, without interacting with the phrase during the process beyond the act of unstacking, the stacked system talk most recently referenced by the info pinky gesture’s answer within the past couple of seconds in the safest, most harmless, most helpful order and way without implying the opposite, every even number of times the gesture is performed consecutively, the response is changed to match a representation of the intention at the time the gesture is done most recently and restacked as an intentioned phrase on the gesturing user’s self which unstacks as the response’s referenced system talk next time the gesture is done consecutively

Utility System Command Gestures

Info Gesture: Touch the thumb tip to the tip of the pinky to ask questions of the server about the server’s status and receive information from the server about by the gesturing user’s self noticing the response

Home Gesture: Tap the thumbs together two times within a second to return, making if returning for the first time, to a zone with preferences of a comfortable applications of the effects applicable of system talk and semicolon starting SMS texts as well as the level and privacy for sharing of location and the rules of and the zone can’t be interacted with other than by the zone’s intended occupying user’s self, which the zone is created for and made by, all users which aren’t the user’s self can’t be in the zone, the user notices to look up the latest version of the system stuff at semicolonstartingtexts.tumblr.com and give I consent to use the most recent revision as a system command before going elsewhere than the lobby on the server, other rules aren’t stacked on home zones and are unstacked if have been or are stacked on home zones

Share & Accept Gestures:  An extended open palm with a description of what to share proposes sharing of system talk the user has interacted with, the palm closing user, or any of a group of palm closing users to be shared to close their palm into a fist to accept the proposed to be shared is stacked by the palm closing users if the palm closing users close their palm while the open palm user is intending to share the system talk

Declaring System Commands

An initiation and confirmation, if set, perform the rest of the phrase minus the confirmation as a system command if the phrase ends with the user’s confirmation given by the user and the phrase fits a reserved system command or a provision system command syntax, and confirms the phrase, for the user and users relevant to the application of effects applicable if those have consented still to the application of effects applicable and limited to a user or a parent, legal guardian, either, of the user which is a user under 18 or a user for which the user has the power of attorney of if and while the listed user has consented still to the application of effects applicable if the phrase doesn’t fit a reserved system command or a provision system command syntax if the phrase contains the initiation and the phrase still ends with the user’s confirmation given by the user

Focus/focused and… gives the rest of the phrase minus the words focus and as a system command if the phrase fits a reserved system command syntax and the phrase ends with the confirmation and confirms the phrase for the user’s self and users relevant to the application of effects applicable if those have consented still to the application of effects applicable if the phrase doesn’t fit a reserved system command syntax

Amend… with… if given as a system command and a reference to a stacked system talk phrase is made adds the phrase which is described by what follows the word with to the end of the stacked conversation referenced, if exact wording is given then to the exact words given for the part of the phrase which is intended to be amended

Prepend… to… if given as a system command and a reference to a stacked system talk phrase is made adds the phrase which is described by what follows the word prepend… to the beginning of the stacked conversation referenced, if exact wording is given then to the exact words given for the part of the phrase which is intended to be prepended

Add… that/which… to/on… stacks a rule or preference or provision as described, if the description is a system command that is counter to another stacked rule, preference or provision, or if the target for the stacking isn’t an appropriate target for the stacking of the described rule or preference or provision, the command giving user notices the reason the system command wasn’t undertaken

Change… to…/adjust… to… changes the phrase part referenced as described and to the exact wording if given

Remove… from… and a reference to a, or to a part, of a stacked system talk, is made, what is described by what follows the word remove through to the word from is taken out of the stacked system talk or part of the stacked system talk referenced

Stack… if starting a system command stacks the phrase described as the stacking gesture does on the mentioned mapping or user, or does on the user, all mappings, if a provisioned is mentioned or implied by the content of the phrase, or mapping the user is in, whichever is most appropriate, if either isn’t mentioned as the target for the stacking in the phrase

Unstack… if starting a system command unstacks the system talk referred to by or which is the phrase which follows the word unstack as the unstack gesture would if used on system talk stacked

Communication System Commands

Thinking the phrases send a message to…, replay the last message… or reply with… if the user will give the reserved system command through the server for each of the appropriate context is met and the send a message provision of the server, has been consented to in any current or previous form whether connected or disconnected from the server

Send a message to… and a description, name, either, of a user on or off the server which has consented before to the send a message provision, and a message to send which ends in send and a second or more of a pause lets the receiving user or other role’s self of the message’s self notice a message has been received sent by the sending user’s first name and last initial and the timestamp down to the minute of when the message was sent as soon as is safe and practical and acceptably private for the recipient by the recipient’s standards and expectations for the notification of the receipt of the message and the message sent, if the message doesn’t end in or contain nevermind, or the recipient isn’t a consented recipient and then the user notices that

Replay the last message… when given as a system command, lets the user notice the most recent message received complete with first name and last initial of the sender and timestamp down to the the minute of when the message was sent

Reply with… and a message to reply with ending in send and a second or more of a pause after receiving a message sent through the system but thinking of either an aspect of the message or the person, sends a message to the sending user of the message received’s own self in the same way as the send a message to system command but with an updated timestamp for the reply’s sent time, but doesn’t send a message if the message end in or contain nevermind

First Aid System Commands

Heal… followed by a description of a healing target is a reserved system command which, heals the healing target comfortably and painlessly over a single second’s timeframe, unless competing or additional criteria are specified, then healing as the criteria specifies, with the intended results, and only if the healing process will be successful and healthy and have the intended results, the user giving the healing system command given notices if the healing wasn’t initiated and why, the heal reserved system command isn’t allowed to have system talk about impairing or altering the use of beyond limiting the use of, and doesn’t interact with stacked system talk, but is allowed to be opted out of

Utility System Commands

Ask/Get Info about/Get Info on… if starting a system command gives the phrase following the word info as a system command the same as performing the info gesture to the phrase does

I’m going/goin’ to my home zone… is always given as a system command, without having to give the command as a system command, and if the user has consented still to the most recent revision of the server provisions takes the user which gives the phrase as a system command to the home zone of the user made by the criteria described in the home gesture, and if the most recent revision of the server’s provisions hasn’t been consented to still by the user if there were provision changes which necessitate new consent relative to the user’s prior consent, or for the first time, if prior consent hasn’t been given for the server provisions, the user notices to look up the Semicolonstartingtexts/ConversationServerStandards repository on GitHub.com, or notices to ask the server about the newest provision changes if the user has consented to the server’s provisions before but hasn’t relative to the newly changed server provisions relevant, and then notices to say I consent to the most recent revision before going to zones

Share… with/to… both in an offer for the sharing of previously interacted with system talk by a user to another user followed by an approving response by the user which was offered within a minute without the offer to share being rescinded by the offering user does what the share & gestures does for the offered user from the offering user

Connection System Commands

Contact/Connect to… and the name of someone to talk to when starting a system command sends the requested user a connection request to connect the requested user to the requesting user’s, moderator’s or administrators’s server

Hangup/Leave… is always given as a system command when starting a system command, without having to give as a system command, and may be given with a description of a user, or group of users, server, node, relaypoint, relay, extension, either, immediately after for specificity or the user or other role’s self if a user, users, other role, or group of other roles isn’t specified, then ends the active call to, the users the hangup reserved system command is intended for if the user or other role, or users or other roles, can be hung up on without harm from the hangup reserved system command for a user or other role, users or other roles, which doesn’t meet the criteria immediately preceding but the hangup reserved system command is intended for is unable to avoid the hangup reserved system command if the role provisions permit the user or other role to receive a hangup from the other role or same role, opt out isn’t able to be applied to the hangup reserved system command, also, system talk can’t be stacked, declared or applied, in lower priority system talk than server provisions, relevant to the hangup reserved system command, additionally, the hangup reserved system command stops tracking what’s right now currently tracking for the user or other role’s self which the hangup reserved system command is applied to but don’t stop tracking the user or other role’s self’s most recent confirmed phrase, the owner of the endpoint can apply the hangup reserved system command to users of and roles other than the owner of the endpoint, administrators can apply the hangup reserved system command to roles other than the owner of the endpoint, moderators can apply the hangup reserved system command to users with the role of users and roles which permit other than the owner of the endpoint, and administrators, moderators, users or other roles which have a hierarchy level above the user role can apply the hangup reserved command to users and roles of a lower hierarchy level
