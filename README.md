Provisions for endpoints and servers for conversations through it

To use on an endpoint, be on a conversation server or an endpoint connected to it and think stack the conversation server standards and the users which can connect are/aren’t … as the definition of the endpoint on the endpoint I’m using

To create a server, be on a conversation server or endpoint connected to it and think stack the definition of the endpoint as the definition of (the server’s name or description)

A helpful provision has been “the server listens to system commands with or without a confirmation which doesn’t contain nevermind and the heal system command must contain a confirmation or end with the phrase given as a system command” for us

Joining endpoints is for collaboration by mirroring changes stated as to the server without naming or describing a specific server in the system command, establishing a connection between the endpoints joined which lasts until the a user of a server on your endpoint or the other participant’s endpoint uses the Unjoin from… reserved system command
