To use on an endpoint, be on a conversation server or an endpoint connected to it and think stack the endpoint I’m using is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or relays which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the endpoint I’m using is … as the definition of the endpoint on the endpoint I’m using

To use an object as a relay for an endpoint, be on a conversation server or an endpoint connected to it and think stack the object I want to be a relay is a relay for (the specific endpoint being relayed) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or relays which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the relay I’m using is … as the definition of the relay for (the specific endpoint) on the relay I’m using

To create a server, be on a conversation server or endpoint connected to it and think stack the endpoint I’m using is the Conversation Server Standards in interactions with the server on the endpoint I’m using which is called … and the users which can connect are/aren’t … as the definition of the server on the endpoint
