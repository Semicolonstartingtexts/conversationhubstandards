# Note About Use

Reading the outline above is sufficient knowledge of the Conversation Hub Standards to be considered sufficient informed consent of the provisions described therein in the mappings of a server which utilizes the provisions described in the definition of the hub 


# Instructions

Use an endpoint, waypoint or hub or utilized device to reference the endpoint or waypoint or the effects of the endpoint or hub stating “the conversationhubstandards  repository on GitHub.com extends to the compatible device I own and I’m interacting with’s interactions with me, and if I’m the owner of the endpoint or hub or waypoint or utilized device, whichever I’m closest to in the inheritance chain, the users connected to the compatible device I own’s interactions with the compatible device while connected to the compatible device,”  that enters micro and can be used to setup a hub or be used without a hub to run system commands with and confirm, and set what you want and would want to do with set and confirm

Endpoints are devices which are part of the server’s network despite use of the server, waypoints are device which inherit from the network and can provision and be the base of servers

Micro is entered by suspending the hub, endpoint or waypoint, or extending the server to a device, and can be used in tandem with the server, even suspended, to let you create abilities which become system commands and set how you want to interact with the system by using the phrase “… Set and confirm” or use the system commands you set up, with your cue and “… and confirm”, while suspended, the user still has all the provisions of the server

Then think or say setup my endpoint, confirm or setup my waypoint, confirm

To stack a hub use the add a hub system command, and use allow and restrict access to limit user access and set and adjust top-level inherited or private provisions to set what trickles down the inheritance chain and how users will interact with your endpoint and inheriting waypoints

To create a waypoint inheriting from the endpoint your hub is on, people can ask to have their phone or device setup as a waypoint while on the server, pending approval from the endpoint

Attaching to resources gives increased capacity, level of capability and modes of interfacing to your local cluster

Extending to devices adds functionality to the server

Joining lobbies grows the shared lobby of the joined lobbies, unjoining lobbies shrinks the shared lobby of the joined lobby

Suspending switches a waypoint or endpoint to micro, a lightweight framework for setup and uninstall for suspended endpoints and waypoints or for imbuings and utilized devices to use to create and use abilities and confirmed seeded rules which are treated as confirmed phrases by the hub

# Community Provisions

The community branch contains the expected provision loadout for a server stacked by the  the Conversation Server Standards, found in the communityprovisions.md file, the communityprovisions.md provisions can’t be removed

# Uninstalling

To uninstall, enter micro by suspending the endpoint or waypoint and use the clean uninstall the repository ability
