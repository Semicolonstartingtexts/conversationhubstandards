# Note About Use

Reading the outline above is sufficient knowledge of the Conversation Server Standards to be considered sufficient informed consent of the provisions described therein in the mappings of a server which utilizes the provisions described in the definition of the server 


# Instructions

To use on an endpoint, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint, or own or be a systems administrator of an endpoint and think stack the endpoint I own or am a systems administrator of is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or relays which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the endpoint I’m using is … and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relaypoints of the endpoint are …) as the definition of the endpoint on the endpoint

To use an object as a node, be on a conversation server or interacting with an endpoint or relaypoint connected to an endpoint or relaypoint and think stack the object I want to be a node is a node for (the specific endpoint to be a node of) and is the Conversation Server Standards what is considered the server by the node and the stacked by relaypoint or endpoint and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t …  and the users which can connect are/aren’t as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the node

To use an object as a relaypoint, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint or relaypoint and have a role of administrator or be an owner of the endpoint or relaypoint and think stack the object I want to be a node is a node for (the specific endpoint to be a relaypoint of) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the relaypoint I’m using is what is considered the server of (the specific endpoint to be a relaypoint of) and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relaypoints of the relaypoint are …) as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the relaypoint

To create a server, be on a conversation server or interacting with endpoint or effects of the endpoint or relaypoint connected to the endpoint or relaypoint and be an owner of the endpoint or relaypoint or hold an administrator role on the endpoint or relaypoint and think stack the endpoint or, also as an option, the effects of the endpoint, the endpoint will be inferred from the effects of the endpoint, or relaypoint I’m interacting with is the Conversation Server Standards in interactions with the server on the endpoint or relaypoint I’m interacting with which is called … and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relays of the server are …) as the definition of the server on the endpoint or relaypoint

To use an object as a relay for a server, be on a conversation server connected to an endpoint or relaypoint or own the connected endpoint or relaypoint or be a systems administrator of the connected endpoint or relaypoint or hold an administrator role on the conversation server and think stack the object I want to be a relay is a relay for (the specific server) on (the specific endpoint) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if any, allowances or restrictions of relays  of the server are …) as the definition of the relay for (the specific server) on the relay

Joining nodes grows the shared lobby of the joined nodes, unjoining nodes shrinks the shared lobby of the joined nodes

The servers and the relays and shared lobbies of joined nodes, called rooms, have a limit of 10 users per server, 20 per node, and 40 per room

# Community Provisions

The community branch contains community additions to the Conversation Server Standards, and in the communityprovisions.md file, these are merged in from time to time, there's helpful provisions to add to your server, to use, use an initiation and confirmation or confirmed phrase to add provisions to your server matching the file or update the relevant server provisions to the file
