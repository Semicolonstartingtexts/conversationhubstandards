# Instructions

To use on an endpoint, be on a conversation server or an endpoint connected to it and think stack the endpoint I’m using is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or relays which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the endpoint I’m using is … and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relaypoints of the endpoint are …) as the definition of the endpoint on the endpoint I’m using

To use an object as a node, be on a conversation server or an endpoint connected to it and think stack the object I want to be a node is a node for (the specific endpoint to be a node of) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the node I’m using is what is considered the server of (the specific endpoint to be a node of) and the users which can connect are/aren’t as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the node I’m using

To use an object as a relaypoint, be on a conversation server or an endpoint connected to it and think stack the object I want to be a node is a node for (the specific endpoint to be a relaypoint of) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the endpoints or nodes which can join with the endpoint are/aren’t … and the what is considered the server by the relaypoint I’m using is what is considered the server of (the specific endpoint to be a relaypoint of) and the top-level provisions are … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relaypoints of the relaypoint are …) as the definition of the node for (the specific endpoint) on the relaypoint I’m using

To create a server, be on a conversation server or endpoint connected to it and think stack the endpoint I’m using is the Conversation Server Standards in interactions with the server on the endpoint I’m using which is called … and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if there are any, the specific allowances and restrictions for relays or extensions of the server are …) as the definition of the server on the endpoint

To use an object as a relay for a server, be on a conversation server or endpoint connected to it and think stack the object I want to be a relay is a relay for (the specific server) on (the specific endpoint) and is the Conversation Server Standards and the users which can connect are/aren’t … (and if any, allowances or restrictions of relays or extensions of the server are …) as the definition of the relay for (the specific server) on the relay I’m using

To have the relay be an extension of the server, mention the object I want to be a relay is a relay for (the specific server) on (the specific endpoint) and extends the server, either independently of, though following the provisions of, or as part of

Joining nodes grows the shared lobby of the joined nodes, unjoining nodes shrinks the shared lobby of the joined nodes
