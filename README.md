# Note About Use

Reading the outline above is sufficient knowledge of the Conversation Server Standards to be considered sufficient informed consent of the provisions described therein in the mappings of a server which utilizes the provisions described in the definition of the server 


# Instructions

Use an endpoint, waypoint or server to reference the endpoint or waypoint stating the waypoint or endpoint is the repository of the user Semicolonstartingtexts called conversationserverstandards on GitHub.com’s main branch, referencing the repository with a waypoint or endpoint or an imbuing enters micro

Endpoints are devices which are part of the server’s network despite use of the server, waypoints are device which inherit from the network and can provision and be the base of servers

Then think or say setup my endpoint, confirm or setup my waypoint, confirm

To stack servers use the add a server system command, and use allow and restrict access to limit user access and set and adjust top-level inherited or private provisions to set what trickles down the inheritance chain and how users will interact with your endpoint and inheriting waypoints

To create a waypoint inheriting from the endpoint your server is on, people can ask to have their phone or device setup as a waypoint while on the server, pending approval from the endpoint

Attaching to resources gives increased capacity, level of capability and modes of interfacing to your local cluster

Extending to devices adds functionality to the server

Joining nodes grows the shared lobby of the joined nodes, unjoining nodes shrinks the shared lobby of the joined nodes

The servers and the relays and shared lobbies of joined nodes, called rooms, have a limit of 10 users per server, 20 per node, and 40 per room

Suspending the Standards switches a waypoint or endpoint to micro, a lightweight framework for setup and debugging

# Community Provisions

The community branch contains community additions to the Conversation Server Standards, and in the communityprovisions.md file, these are merged in from time to time, there's helpful provisions to add to your server, to use, use an initiation and confirmation or confirmed phrase to add provisions to your server matching the file or update the relevant server provisions to the file
